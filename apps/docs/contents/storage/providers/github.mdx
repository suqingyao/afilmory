# GitHub Storage

GitHub storage is perfect for small galleries, demos, or when you already keep assets in a repository. It's the simplest setup with no additional storage costs.

## Configuration

Configure GitHub storage in `builder.config.ts`:

```typescript
import { defineBuilderConfig } from '@afilmory/builder'

export default defineBuilderConfig(() => ({
  storage: {
    provider: 'github',
    owner: 'your-username',
    repo: 'photo-storage',
    branch: 'main',
    path: 'photos',
    useRawUrl: true, // Use raw.githubusercontent.com CDN
  },
}))
```

## Environment Variables

Add this to your `.env` file:

```bash
GIT_TOKEN=ghp_your_github_token
```

## Getting a GitHub Token

1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Generate a new token (classic) or fine-grained token
3. For classic tokens, grant `repo` scope (or `public_repo` for public repos)
4. For fine-grained tokens, grant `Contents: Read` permission
5. Copy the token to your `.env` file

## Repository Setup

1. Create a new repository (or use an existing one)
2. Upload your photos to a folder (e.g., `photos/`)
3. Commit and push to your repository
4. Configure the builder with the repository details

## Limitations

**File size limits:**
- GitHub enforces ~100MB per file via API
- Repository size should stay under ~1GB for best performance
- Large collections may hit API rate limits

**Best practices:**
- Keep repositories focused and organized
- Use `path` to scope to a specific folder
- Consider using a separate repository for photos

## Raw URL CDN

Setting `useRawUrl: true` uses GitHub's CDN (`raw.githubusercontent.com`) for public access:

```typescript
useRawUrl: true
```

This provides faster access and better caching for public repositories.

## Private Repositories

For private repositories:

1. Use a classic token with `repo` scope, or
2. Use a fine-grained token with `Contents: Read` permission
3. Ensure the token has access to the repository

## Troubleshooting

**Authentication errors:**
- Verify `GIT_TOKEN` is correct and not expired
- Check that the token has the required permissions
- For private repos, ensure the token has `repo` scope

**Rate limiting:**
- GitHub API has rate limits (5,000 requests/hour for authenticated users)
- Large collections may hit limits during initial sync
- Consider using S3 or B2 for very large collections

**File size errors:**
- Ensure no individual file exceeds ~100MB
- Consider compressing large photos or using a different provider
