# Storage Providers

Afilmory supports multiple storage providers for your photo collection. Choose the one that best fits your needs, budget, and technical requirements.

## Available Providers

### [S3 / S3-Compatible](/storage/providers/s3)

**Best for production deployments**

- Scalable and reliable
- CDN-friendly with custom domains
- Works with AWS S3, MinIO, Cloudflare R2, and other S3-compatible services
- Recommended for large collections

### [Aliyun OSS](/storage/providers/oss)

**China-mainland optimized**

- Native endpoint defaults for `oss-` regions
- Works with classic or internal network OSS domains
- Ideal when data residency or ICP compliance is required
- Supports CDN fronting via `customDomain`

### [Tencent COS](/storage/providers/cos)

**Tencent Cloud ecosystems**

- First-class support for COS buckets (`bucket-appid`)
- Automatic `cos.<region>.myqcloud.com` endpoint handling
- Compatible with COS acceleration domains and CLS logging
- Preferred for deployments already on Tencent Cloud

### [B2 (Backblaze B2)](/storage/providers/b2)

**Cost-effective cloud storage**

- S3-compatible API
- Lower cost than AWS S3
- Good performance and reliability
- Great for budget-conscious deployments

### [GitHub](/storage/providers/github)

**Simplest setup for small galleries**

- No additional storage costs
- Easy to manage with Git
- Perfect for demos and small collections
- Limited by repository size (~1GB recommended)

### [Local](/storage/providers/local)

**Development and self-hosting**

- Fastest for local development
- No external dependencies
- Perfect for single-node deployments
- Use when storage and app are on the same machine

### [Eagle](/storage/providers/eagle)

**Direct Eagle 4 integration**

- Publish directly from Eagle library
- Filter by folders and tags
- Great if you already use Eagle for photo management
- Supports folder-to-tag mapping

## Choosing a Provider

**For production:**

- Use **S3** or **B2** for scalability and reliability

**For development:**

- Use **Local** for fastest iteration
- Use **GitHub** for simple demos

**For existing workflows:**

- Use **Eagle** if you already manage photos there
- Use **GitHub** if your photos are already in a repo

## Configuration

All providers are configured in `builder.config.ts`:

```typescript
import { defineBuilderConfig } from '@afilmory/builder'

export default defineBuilderConfig(() => ({
  storage: {
    provider: 's3', // or 'b2', 'github', 'local', 'eagle'
    // ... provider-specific options
  },
}))
```

Credentials and sensitive information should be stored in `.env` and referenced via `process.env`.

See each provider's documentation for specific configuration options.
