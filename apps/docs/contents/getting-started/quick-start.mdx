# Quick Start

This guide will help you deploy your first gallery in about 5 minutes. You'll need Git, pnpm, and Node.js 20+ installed.

## Step 1: Configure Your Site

Copy the example configuration file:

```bash
cp config.example.json config.json
```

Edit `config.json` with your site information:

```json
{
  "name": "My Photo Gallery",
  "description": "A collection of my favorite photos",
  "author": {
    "name": "Your Name",
    "url": "https://yourwebsite.com",
    "avatar": "https://yourwebsite.com/avatar.jpg"
  },
  "social": {
    "twitter": "@yourhandle",
    "github": "yourusername"
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Choose and Configure Storage

Pick a storage provider from the [Storage Providers](/storage/providers) section:

- **S3** - Recommended for production (scalable, CDN-friendly)
- **GitHub** - Simplest setup, great for small collections
- **Local** - Perfect for development and testing
- **B2** - Cost-effective cloud storage
- **Eagle** - Direct integration with Eagle 4 library

Configure your chosen provider in `builder.config.ts` and add credentials to `.env`. See the provider-specific guides for detailed setup instructions.

## Step 3: Generate Thumbnails and Manifest

Run the builder to process your photos:

```bash
pnpm run build:manifest              # Incremental build (only new/changed photos)
pnpm run build:manifest -- --force  # Full rebuild (all photos)
```

This generates:
- **Thumbnails**: `apps/web/public/thumbnails/`
- **Manifest**: `apps/web/src/data/photos-manifest.json`

## Step 4: Preview Locally

Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Your gallery will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Step 5: Deploy

Choose your deployment method:

### Static Hosting

Build the static site:

```bash
pnpm --filter web build
```

Then publish the `apps/web/dist` folder along with `thumbnails` and `photos-manifest.json` to your static host. See [Deployment](/deployment) for platform-specific guides.

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

For better SEO and Open Graph support, deploy the Next.js wrapper:

```bash
pnpm --filter @afilmory/ssr build
```

Deploy to Vercel or any Node.js host. See [Vercel Deployment](/deployment/vercel) for details.

## What You Have Now

- ✅ A working gallery with your photos
- ✅ Thumbnails and metadata ready for deployment
- ✅ Local preview running at `http://localhost:5173`
- ✅ Deployment-ready build artifacts

## Next Steps

- **Customize your gallery**: Edit `config.json` and `builder.config.ts`
- **Add more photos**: Run `pnpm run build:manifest` again after adding photos
- **Deploy**: Follow the [Deployment Guide](/deployment) for your platform
- **Learn more**: Check out [Architecture](/architecture) and [Builder](/builder) documentation
